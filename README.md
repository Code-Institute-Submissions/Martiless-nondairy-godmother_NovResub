# Non-dairy Godmother Tea Rooms: 

This website is designed for a fictional vegan restaurant based in Cork, Ireland. 

This website has been created as the Fourth Milestone project for Code Institute's Full Stack Software Development Diploma. It was built using a Full-Stack Toolkit. GitPod was used for writing the code for this website, as well as committing and pushing to GitHub. GitHub was then used to store the project after it had been pushed from GitPod. Once all the code had been written, Heroku was then used to deploy the website.

## Development Planes:
To create a website that is comprehensive and informative for a user, as a developer you need to look at all aspects of the website and how someone who visits your website will use it. You have to consider all the user stories that have been outlined in the above sections.  

## Strategy
The strategy principal looks at user needs, as well product/service objectives. This websites target audience was broken down into three categories:
### Roles: 
* New User
* Existing User

#### The website needs to allow the restaurant owner to:  
*   

## Scope:  

With the structure in place, it was then time to move onto the scope plane. This was all about developing website requirements based on the goals set out in the strategy plane. These requirements are broken down into two categories. 
### Content Requirements:
1. The user will be looking for:
      *

## Skeleton:
[Wireframes]( "Link to Wireframe screenshots") were created to set out the initial appearance of the website while also making sure to keep the end-user in mind at all times. Wireframes were created using [Balsamiq]().  

## Surface:

### Color: 
To create a visually appealing website but also a website that was easy for people to read I used several different sites to test color contrast. I wanted to make sure the color scheme was not only eye-catching but also that it passed the LightHouse Accessibility test. 

Initially, I looked at what colors work best with the green color I had chosen as my main color. I did this by using a color wheel.

Following on from the color wheel, an orange was decided upon to contrast the green. To make sure text could be seen without issue on my chosen colors I used [Coolors]() color contrast checker.
