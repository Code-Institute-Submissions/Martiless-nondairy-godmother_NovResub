# Non-dairy Godmother: 

This page contains the Wireframes Non-dairy Godmother, a fictional vegan restaurant created for my forth milestone project with Code Institute.

As you can see the finished project is slightly different from the original mockup. This changes were made for a number of reasons:
 1. Design changes that were made throught out the project to enhance the user experience
 1. Lack of knowledge for some feature and time restraints in both researching and implenting them
